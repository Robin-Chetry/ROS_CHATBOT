It is useless for a robot to be\\na mechanical prodigy without providing it with software that processes the\\ninformation from the sensors to send the correct commands to the actuators to fulﬁll\\nthe mission for which it was created. This chapter introduces the middlewares for\\nprogramming robots and, in particular, to ROS2[8], which will be the one used in\\nthis book.\\nFirst of all, nobody starts programming a robot from scratch. Robot software is\\nvery complex since we have to face the problem that a robot performs tasks in a real,\\ndynamic, and sometimes unpredictable world. It also must deal with a wide variety\\nof models and types of sensors and actuators. Implementing the necessary drivers or\\nadapting to new hardware components is a titanic eﬀort doomed to failure.\\nMiddleware is a layer of software between the operating system and user appli-\\ncations to carry out the programming of applications in some domains. Middleware\\nusually contains more than libraries, including development and monitoring tools, and\\na development methodology. Figure 1.1 shows a schematic of a system that includes\\nmiddleware for developing applications for robots.\\nRobot programming middlewares provide drivers, libraries, and methodologies.\\nThey also usually oﬀer development, integration, execution, and monitoring tools.\\nThroughout the history of Robotics, a multitude of robot programming middlewares\\nhave emerged. Few of them have survived the robot for which they were designed or\\nhave expanded from the laboratories where they were implemented. There are no-\\ntable examples (Yarp[5], Carmen[6], Player/Stage[2], etc), although without a doubt\\nthe most successful in the last decade has been ROS[7], which is currently considered\\nRobot/Computer Hardware\\nOperating System\\nMiddleware for Robots\\nRobotic\\nApplication Tools\\nOther\\nApplications\\nFigure 1.1: Representation of software layers in a robot.\\nDOI: 10.1201/9781003289623-1 1'),\n",

It is unnecessary to have previous experience in ROS2 since we\\nwill describe its concepts, tools, and methodologies from the beginning without the\\nneed of previous experience. We will assume average Linux and programming skills.\\nWe will use the two programming languages oﬃcially supported in ROS2 (C++ and\\nPython), which coincide with the languages most used in general in Robotics.\\n1.1 ROS2 OVERVIEW\\nThe meaning of the acronym ROS is Robot Operating System. It is not an operating\\nsystem that replaces Linux or Windows but a middleware that increases the system’s\\ncapabilities to develop Robotic applications. The number 2 indicates that it is the\\nsecond generation of this middleware. The reader who already knows the ﬁrst version\\nof ROS (sometimes referred to as ROS1) will ﬁnd many similar concepts, and there\\nare already several teaching resources1 for the ROS1 programmer who lands on ROS2.\\nIn this book, we will assume no previous knowledge of ROS. It will be more and more\\ncommon for this to happen, as there are now more and more reasons to learn ROS2\\ndirectly instead of going through ROS1 ﬁrst.\\nAlso, there are already some excellent oﬃcial ROS2 tutorials, so the approach\\nin this book is intended to be diﬀerent. The description will be complete and with\\na methodology oriented to developing robotic applications that make the robot do\\nsomething “smart”, from robotic engineer to robotic engineer, emphasizing essential\\nissues that come from experience in the development of software in robots. It will not\\nhurt for the reader to explore the tutorials available to complete their training and\\nﬁll in the gaps that do not ﬁt in this book:\\n•Oﬃcial ROS2 tutorials: https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials.html\\n•The Robotics Back-End tutorials: https://roboticsbackend.com/category/ros2/\\n•ROS2 for ROS2 developers:https://github.com/fmrico/ros to ros2 talk examples\\nThe starting point is a Linux Ubuntu 20.04 LTS system installed on a computer\\nwith an AMD64-bit architecture, the most extended one in a personal laptop or\\ndesktop computer.

Each distribution has a name and\\nis linked to a version of Ubuntu. The software in a distribution is also guaranteed\\nto work correctly with the software version present on the system. It is possible\\nto use another Linux distribution (Ubuntu, Fedora, Red Hat ...), but the reference\\nis Ubuntu. ROS2 also works on Windows and Mac, but this document focuses on\\nLinux development. We will use the ROS2 Foxy Fitzroy version, which corresponds\\nto Ubuntu 20.04.\\nIn this book, we will approach ROS2 from three diﬀerent but complementary\\ndimensions:\\n•The Community: The ROS community is a fundamental element when de-\\nveloping applications for robots with this middleware. In addition to providing\\ntechnical documentation, there is a vast community of developers who con-\\ntribute with their own applications and utilities through public repositories, to\\nwhich other developers can contribute. Another member of the community may\\nhave already developed something you need.\\n•Computation Graph: The Computational Graph is a running ROS2 appli-\\ncation. This graph is made up of nodes and arcs. The Node, the primary com-\\nputing units in ROS2, can collaborate with other nodes using several diﬀerent\\ncommunication paradigms to compose a ROS2 application. This dimension also\\naddresses the monitoring tools, which are also nodes that are inserted in this\\ngraph.\\n•The Workspace: The Workspace is the set of software installed on the robot\\nor computer, and the programs that the user develops. In contrast to the Com-\\nputational Graph, which has a dynamic nature, the Workspace is static. This\\ndimension also addresses the development tools to build the elements of the\\nComputational Graph.\\n1.1.1 The ROS Community\\nThe ﬁrst dimension of ROS2 to consider is the ROS Community. The Open Source\\nRobotics Foundation2 greatly enhanced the community of users and developers. ROS2\\nis not only a robot programming middleware, but it is also a development methodol-\\nogy, a established software delivery mechanisms, and a set of resources made available\\nto members of the ROS community.\\nROS2 is fundamentally Open Source, which means that it is software released\\nunder a license in which the user has rights of use, study, change, and redistribu-\\ntion. Many Open Source licenses modulate certain freedoms on this software, but\\nessentially we can assume these rights. The most common licenses for ROS2 software\\npackages are Apache 2 and BSD, although developers are free to use others.\\nROS2 organizes the software following a federal model, providing the technical\\nmechanisms that make it possible. Each developer, company, or institution can de-\\nvelop their software freely, responsible for managing it. It is also widespread that small\\n2https://www.openrobotics.org'),\n",

These entities create software packages for ROS2 that\\nthey can make available in public repositories or be part of a ROS2 distribution as\\nbinaries. Nobody can force these entities to migrate their software to new versions\\nof ROS2. However, the inertia of many essential and popular packages is enough to\\nguarantee their continuity.\\nThe importance of this development modeling is that it fosters the growth of the\\nROS community. From a practical point of view, this is key to the success of a robot\\nprogramming middleware. One of the desirable characteristics of this type of middle-\\nware is its support for many sensors and actuators. Nowadays, many manufacturers\\nof these components oﬃcially support their drivers for ROS2 since they know that\\nthere are many potential customers and that there are many developers who check\\nif a speciﬁc component is supported in ROS2 before buying them. In addition, these\\ncompanies usually develop this software in open repositories where users communi-\\nties can be created reporting bugs and even sending their patches. If you want your\\nlibrary or tool for robots to be widely used, supporting ROS2 may be the way.\\nThe packages in ROS2 are organized in distributions. A ROS2 distribution is\\nmade up of a multitude of packages that can work well together. Usually, this implies\\nthat it is tied to a speciﬁc version of a base system. ROS2 uses Ubuntu Linux versions\\nas reference. This guarantees stability since otherwise, the dependencies of versions\\nof diﬀerent packages and libraries would make ROS2 a real mess. When an entity\\nreleases speciﬁc software, it does so for a given distribution. It is common to maintain\\nmultiple development branches for each distribution.\\nROS2 has released a total of seven distributions to date (January’22), which we\\ncan see in Figure 1.2 . Each distribution has a name whose initial increases and a\\ndiﬀerent logo (and a diﬀerent T-shirt model!).

A node is an object\\nof class Node, in general, whether it is written in C++ or Python.\\nA node can access the Computation Graph and provides mechanisms to commu-\\nnicate with other nodes through 3 types of paradigms:\\n•Publication/Subscription: It is an asynchronous communication, where N\\nnodes publish messages to a topic that reaches its M subscribers. A topic is like\\na communication channel that accepts messages of a unique type. This type\\nof communication is the most common in ROS2. A very representative case is\\nthe node that contains the driver of a camera that publishes images in a topic.\\nAll the nodes in a system needing images from the camera to carry out their\\nfunction subscribe to this topic.\\n•Services: It is a synchronous communication in which a node requests another\\nnode and waits for the response. This communication usually requires an im-\\nmediate response so as not to aﬀect the control cycle of the node that calls\\nthe service. An example could be the request to the mapping service to reset a\\nmap, with a response indicating if the call succeeded.\\n•Actions: These are asynchronous communications in which a node makes a\\nrequest to another node. These requests usually take time to complete, and the\\ncalling node may periodically receive feedback or the notiﬁcation that it has ﬁn-\\nished successfully or with some error. A navigation request is an example of this\\ntype of communication. This request is possibly time-consuming, whereby the\\nnode requesting the robot to navigate should not be blocked while completing.\\nThe function of a node in a computational graph is to perform processing or\\ncontrol. Therefore, they are considered active elements with some alternatives in\\nterms of their execution model:\\n•Iterative execution: It is popular in the control software for a node to execute\\nits control cycle at a speciﬁc frequency. This approach allows controlling how\\nmany computational resources a node requires, and the output ﬂow remains\\nconstant. For example, a node calculating motion commands to actuators at\\n20 Hz based on their status.\\n•Event-oriented execution: The execution of these nodes is determined by the\\nfrequency at which certain events occur, in this case, the arrival of messages\\nat this node. For example, a node that, for each image it receives, performs\\ndetection on it and produces an output. The frequency at which an output\\noccurs depends on the frequency at which images arrive. If no images reach it,\\nit produces no output.\\nNext, we will show several examples of computational graphs.

When creating a resource, for example, a publisher, we can specify its name relative,\\nabsolute (begins with “/”), or privately (begins with “ ∼”). Furthermore, we can deﬁne\\na namespace whose objective is to isolate resources from other namespaces by adding the\\nworkspace’s name as the ﬁrst component of the name. Namespaces are helpful, for example,\\nin multirobot applications. Let’s see an example of the resulting name of a topic based on\\nthe node name and the namespace:\\nname Result: (node: my node / ns: none) Result: (node: my node / ns: my ns)\\nmy topic /my topic /my ns/my topic\\n/my topic /my topic /my topic\\n∼my topic /my node/my topic /my ns/my node/my topic\\nFurther readings:\\n• http://wiki.ros.org/Names\\n• https://design.ros2.org/articles/topic and service names.html\\nThis node runs inside a separate process. The Computation Graph shows another\\nprocess that subscribes to the bumper’s topic, and based on the information it re-\\nceives, it publishes the speed at which the robot should move. We have set the node’s\\nexecution frequency to indicate that it makes a control decision at 10 Hz, whether or\\nnot it receives messages about the status of the bumper.\\nThis Computation Graph comprises two nodes and two topics, with their respec-\\ntive publication/subscription connections.\\nLet’s evolve the robot and the application. Let’s add a laser and a 3D camera (also\\ncalled RGBD camera). For each sensor, a node must access the sensor and present it\\nwith a ROS2 interface. As we said earlier, publishing the data from a sensor is the\\nmost convenient way to make this data available in a computational graph.\\nThe application now makes the robot move towards people or objects detected\\nfrom the 3D image of an RGBD camera. A laser sensor avoids colliding as we move.\\nThe Computation Graph shown in Figure 1.5 summarizes the application:\\n•The control node runs at 20 Hz sending control commands to the robot base.\\nIt subscribes to the topic /scan to check the obstacles around it.\\n•The process contains two nodes that detect people and objects, respectively.\\nBoth need the image and depth information from the camera to determine the\\nposition of detected objects. Each detection is published in two diﬀerent topics,\\nusing a standard message designed for 3D detection.\\n•The control node subscribes to these topics to carry out its task.\\nIn the last example, the robot used is Tiago 4. Let’s assume that there is only one\\nnode that provides its functionality. We use in this example two subscribers (speed\\ncommands to move its base and trajectory commands to move its neck) and two\\npublishers (laser information and the 3D image from a RGBD camera).\\n4https://pal-robotics.com/es/robots/tiago/\\nwith ROS2'),\n",

The navigation manager coordinates the planner (in charge of\\ncreating routes from the robot’s position to the destination) and the controller\\n(which makes the robot follow the created route). The planner needs the map\\nprovided by a node that loads the environment map and the robot’s position\\nthat calculates a location node.\\n•Communication between both subsystems is done using ROS2 actions. The\\nNavigation Behavior sets a goal and is notiﬁed when it is complete. It also\\nperiodically receives progress toward the destination. Actions are also used to\\ncoordinate the planner and controller within the navigation system.\\nThroughout this subsection, we have shown computation graphs. Every time we\\nimplement an application in ROS2, we design a computational graph. We establish\\nwhich nodes we need and what their interactions are. We must decide if a node is\\nexecuted at a speciﬁc frequency or if some event causes its execution (request or\\nmessage). We can develop all the nodes, or include in the Computation Graph nodes\\ndeveloped by third parties.'),\n",

This activation process\\nis accumulative. We can activate an initial workspace, that we call underlay. Later,\\nwe can activate another workspace that we will call overlay because it overlays the\\nprevious underlay workspace. The overlay package dependencies should be satisﬁed\\nin the underlay. If a package in the overlay already exists in the underlay, the overlay\\npackage hides the one in the underlay.\\nUsually, the workspace containing the basic ROS2 installation is activated ini-\\ntially. This is the most common underlay in a ROS2 system. Then, the workspace,\\nwhere the user is developing their own packages, is activated.\\nPackages can be installed from sources or with the system installation system.\\nOn Ubuntu Linux 20.04, which is the reference in this book, it is carried out with deb\\npackages using tools like apt. Each ROS2 package is packaged in a deb package. The\\nnames of deb packages in a distribution are easily identiﬁable because their names\\nstart with ros-<distro>-<ros2 package name>. In order to access these packages,\\nconﬁgure the APT ROS2 repository:\\n$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl gnupg2 lsb-release\\n$ sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key\\n-o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg\\n$ echo \"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture)\\nsigned-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg]\\nhttp://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(source /etc/os-release && echo\\n$UBUNTU CODENAME) main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null\\n$ sudo apt-get update\\nOf course, the installation dependencies of the Deb packages are those of the ROS2\\npackage. The following command shows the ROS2 packages available to install:\\n$ apt-cache search ros-foxy\\nROS2 Foxy installation. Instructions are located athttps://docs.ros.org/\\nen/foxy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html. Basically, ROS2 Foxy is\\ninstalled just typing:\\n$ sudo apt update\\n$ sudo apt install ros-foxy-desktop\\nAll the ROS2 software installed by apt is in /opt/ros/foxy. On an Ubuntu\\n20.04 system, installing the ROS2 Galactic version or the ROS Noetic Ninjemys\\nversion is also possible. If both are installed, they are in /opt/ros/galactic and\\n/opt/ros/noetic, respectively. We could even install one of these ROS distributions\\nby compiling its source code in some other location. Because of this, and because it is\\nnot recommended (unless you know what you are doing) to mix ROS distributions,\\ninstalling a distribution does not “activate” it. The activation is done by executing\\nin a terminal:\\n$ source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash'),\n",

Packages are those that have a package.xml ﬁle in their\\nroot directory.\\nIn this workspace, there are many packages with dependencies on other packages\\nnot part of the ROS2 Foxy distribution. To add the sources of these packages to the\\nworkspace, we will use the vcstool6:\\n$ cd ∼/bookros2 ws/src\\n$ vcs import . < book ros2/third parties.repos\\nThe command vcs reads a list of repositories from a .repos ﬁle and clones them\\ninto the speciﬁed directory.

All of them fully or partially implement the DDS standard deﬁned by the\\nOMG16. ROS2 can use all of these DDS implementations. Very few ROS2 developers\\ncould notice when using one or the other. Still, when we begin to require high per-\\nformance in latency, amount of data, or resources used, we can ﬁnd some diﬀerences\\nthat make us choose one with objective criteria.\\nThe APIs of these DDS implementations do not have to be the same. In fact, they\\nare not. For this reason, and to simplify the rcl layer, an underlying layer called rmw\\nhas been implemented, which presents the rcl programmer with a uniﬁed API to ac-\\ncess the functionality of each supported DDS implementation. Selecting which DDS to\\nuse is trivial, requiring just modifying an environment variable,RMW\\nIMPLEMENTATION.\\nThe oﬃcial version of DDS in the Foxy distribution is FastDDS, while in Galactic,\\nit is CycloneDDS. These vendors compete (in what ironically came to be called the\\nDDS Wars) to be the predominant implementation. Hopefully, the main beneﬁciary\\nof this competition will be the ROS2 community.\\n1.3 ABOUT THIS BOOK\\nThis book is intended to be a journey through programming robots in ROS2, present-\\ning several projects where the main ROS2 concepts are applied. Prior knowledge of\\nROS/ROS2 is not needed. Many of the concepts we will see will sound very familiar\\nto ROS1 programmers. They will ﬁnd interesting the changes that ROS2 presents\\nconcerning the previous version.\\nWe will use C++ as a vehicular language, although we will include one in Python\\nin our ﬁrst examples. We can develop complex and powerful projects in Python but\\nin my experience with robots, I prefer to use a compiled language rather than an\\ninterpreted one. Similarly, the concepts explained with C++ are equally valid with\\nPython. Another decision is to use Linux (speciﬁcally Ubuntu GNU / Linux 20.04\\nLTS) instead of Windows or Mac since it is the reference platform in ROS2 and the\\none that I consider predominant in Robotics.\\nI will assume that the reader is a motivated engineering student or an experi-\\nmented engineer/professional. We will be using many C++ features up to C++17, in-\\ncluding smart pointers (shared\\nptr and unique ptr), containers (vector, list, map),\\ngeneric programming, and more. I will try to explain complex code parts from a\\nlanguage point of view, but the less advanced reader may need to consult some ref-\\nerences17,18. I also count on the reader to know CMake, Git, gdb, and other common\\ntools developers use in Linux environments.

The following is an example of how to\\nset QoS policies in C++:\\npublisher = node->create_publisher<std_msgs::msg::String>(\\n\"chatter\", rclcpp::QoS(100).transient_local().best_effort());\\nDefault Reliable Volatile Keep Last\\nServices Reliable Volatile Normal Queue\\nSensor Best Eﬀort Volatile Small Queue\\nDParameters Reliable Volatile Large Queue\\nEach publisher speciﬁes its QoS, and each publisher can specify its QoS as well.

For example, the driver of a sensor should publish its readings with a\\nreliable QoS policy. The subscribers decide if they want the communication to be eﬀectively\\nreliable or prefer Best Eﬀort. In this case, these publishers could be:\\npublisher_ = create_publisher<sensor_msgs::msg::LaserScan>(\\n\"scan\", rclcpp::SensorDataQoS().reliable());\\nand the subscribers could use the same QoS, or remove the reliable part.\\nFurther readings:\\n• https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Concepts/About-Quality-of-Service-Settings.html\\n• https://design.ros2.org/articles/qos.html\\n• https://discourse.ros.org/t/about-qos-of-images/18744/16\\nRun the program:\\n$ ros2 run br2 basics publisher class\\nAnd see what we are publishing in the topic:\\nwith ROS2'),\n",

This exercise will put together many things we have pre-\\nsented and show how eﬀective it is to program a robot using ROS2. In addition, we\\nwill address some issues in robot programming.\\nThe Bump and Go behavior uses the robot’s sensor to detect nearby obstacles\\nin front of the robot. The robot moves forward, and when it detects an obstacle, it\\ngoes back and turns for a ﬁxed time to move forward again. Although it is a simple\\nbehavior, some decision-making approach is recommended since our code, even if it\\nis simple, can start to grow out of order as we solve the problems that may arise. In\\nthis case, we will use a Finite State Machine (FSM).\\nAn FSM is a mathematical computational model that we can use to deﬁne the\\nbehavior of a robot. It is made up of states and transitions. A robot keeps producing\\nan output in one state until the condition of an outgoing transition is fulﬁlled and it\\ntransits to the target state of this transition.\\nApplying an FSM can signiﬁcantly reduce the complexity of solving a problem\\nwhen we implement simple behaviors. For a moment, try to think about how to\\napproach the Bump and Go problem using loops, ifs, temporary variables, counters,\\ntimers. It would be a complex program to understand and follow its logic.

We can use the original frame of the sensor since it\\nis aligned, a little forward and up, with base footprint.\\nAn essential feature of ROS is standardization. Once a consensus has been reached\\nin the community on the format in which the information produced by a laser sensor\\nis encoded, all laser driver developers should use this format. This consensus means\\nthat the message format must be general enough to support any laser sensor. In the\\nsame way, an application developer must exploit the information in this message for\\nhis program to function correctly regardless of the characteristics of the sensor that\\nproduced the sensory reading. The great advantage of this approach is that we can\\nmake any ROS program work with any ROS-supported laser, allowing the software\\nto be truly portable between robots. Also, an experienced ROS developer does not\\nhave to learn new, manufacturer-deﬁned formats. Finally, using this format puts at\\nyour disposal a wide variety of utilities to ﬁlter or monitor laser information. This\\napproach applies to all types of sensors and actuators in ROS, which may be one\\nreason for the success of this framework.\\nRegarding the action modelin this problem, we will send the robot translation\\nand rotation speeds to topic /nav\\nvel, which is of type geometry msgs/msg/Twist.\\nLet’s see this message format:\\n$ ros2 interface show geometry msgs/msg/Twist\\nVector3 linear\\nVector3 angular\\n$ ros2 interface show geometry msgs/msg/Vector3\\nfloat64 x\\nfloat64 y\\nfloat64 z\\nAll robots use this message format to receive speeds, allowing generic teleopera-\\ntion programs (with keyboard, joystick, mobiles, etc.) and navigation in ROS. Once\\nagain, we are talking about standardization.\\nThe geometry\\nmsgs/msg/Twist message is much more generic than what our\\nrobot supports. We cannot make it move in Z (it cannot ﬂy) or move laterally with\\njust two wheels. It is a diﬀerential robot. We could probably do more translations and\\nrotations if we had a quadcopter. We can only make it go forward or backward, rotate,\\nor combine both. For this reason, we can only use the ﬁeldslinear.x and angular.z\\n(rotation to the Z-axis, positive velocities to the left, as indicated in Figure 3.2).\\n3.2 COMPUTATION GRAPH\\nThe Computation Graph of this application will be pretty simple: A single node that\\nsubscribes to the laser topic publishes speed commands to the robot.\\nThe control logic interprets the input sensory information and produces the con-\\ntrol commands. This logic is what we are going to implement with an FSM. The logic\\ncontrol will run iteratively at 20 Hz. The execution frequencies depend on publishing\\nthe control commands. If it is not published above 20 Hz, some robots stop, which\\nis very convenient so that there are no robots without control in the laboratory.'),\n",

Why are we using remaps instead of passing the name\\nof the topics as parameters? Well, it is an alternative that many ROS2 developers\\nadvocate. Perhaps this alternative is more convenient when a node does not always\\nhave the same subscribers/publishers, and this can only be speciﬁed in a YAML ﬁle\\nof conﬁguration parameters.\\nA good approach is that if the number of publishers and subscribers in a node is\\nknown, use generic topic names, like the ones used in this example, and perform a\\nremap. It may even be better to use common topic names ( /cmd\\nvel is a common\\ntopic for many robots). A seasoned ROS2 programmer will read in the documentation\\nwhat topics it uses, ﬁnd out with a ros2 node info, and quickly make it work with\\nremaps, instead of looking for the correct parameters to be set up in the conﬁguration\\nﬁles.\\nAlthough this book primarily uses C++, in this chapter we will provide two sim-\\nilar implementations, one in C++ and other in Python, each in diﬀerent packages:\\nbr2\\nfsm bumpgo cpp and br2 fsm bumpgo py.

This subsystem allows deﬁning diﬀerent reference\\naxes (also called frames) and the geometric relationship between them, even when this\\nrelationship is constantly changing. Any coordinate in a frame can be recalculated to\\nanother frame without the need for tedious manual calculations.\\nIn my experience teaching ROS courses, who has had to deal with similar calcu-\\nlations without TFs, shows a big surprise and happiness when they meet them.\\nIts importance in ROS is due to the need to model the parts and components of\\na robot geometrically. It has many applications in navigation and location, as well\\nas manipulation. They have been used to position several cameras in a building or\\nmotion capture systems1.\\nA robot perceives the environment through sensors placed somewhere on the\\nrobot and performs actions for which it needs to specify some spatial position. For\\ninstance:\\n•A distance sensor (laser or RGBD) generates a set of points ( x,y,z ) that indi-\\ncate the detected obstacles.\\n•A robot moves its end eﬀector by specifying a target position (x,y,z,roll,\\npitch,yaw).\\n•A robot moves to a point (x,y,yaw ) on a map.\\nAll these coordinates are references to a frame. In a robot, there are multiple\\nframes (for sensors, actuators, etc). The relationship between these frames must be\\nknown to reason, for example, the coordinate of an obstacle detected by the laser\\non the arm reference axis to avoid it. Frames relationships are the displacement and\\nrotation of a frame to another frame. Algebraically, this is done using homogeneous\\ncoordinates for the coordinates and RT transformation matrices for relations. Having\\nthe coordinates of a point P in frame A, this is PA, we can calculate PB in frame B\\nusing the transformation matrix RTA→B as follows:\\n1https://github.com/MOCAP4ROS2-Project\\nDOI: 10.1201/9781003289623-4 63'),\n",

Just have a transform broadcaster and send transforms to\\nthe TF system:\\ngeometry_msgs::msg::TransformStamped detection_tf;\\ndetection_tf.header.frame_id = \"base_footprint\";\\ndetection_tf.header.stamp = now();\\ndetection_tf.child_frame_id = \"detected_obstacle\";\\ndetection_tf.transform.translation.x = 1.0;\\ntf_broadcaster_->sendTransform(detection_tf);\\nGetting a transform is easy too. Having a TF buﬀer that a transform listener\\nupdates, we can ask for the geometric transformation from one frame to another. Not\\neven these frames need to be directly connected. Any calculation is done transparently\\nfor the developer:\\ntf2_ros::Buffer tfBuffer;\\ntf2_ros::TransformListener tfListener(tfBuffer);\\n...\\ngeometry_msgs::msg::TransformStamped odom2obstacle;\\nodom2obstacle = tfBuffer_.lookupTransform(\"odom\", \"detected_obstacle\", tf2::TimePointZero);\\nThe above code calculates odom → base\\nfootprint → detected obstacle au-\\ntomatically. The third argument of lookupTransform indicates the instant of time\\nfrom which we want to obtain the transform. tf2::TimePointZero indicates the lat-\\nest available. If we are transforming points of a laser, for example, we should use the\\ntimestamp that appears in the header of the laser message, because if a robot or the\\nlaser has moved since then, the transformation in another instant will not be exact\\n(much can change in few milliseconds in a robot). Finally, be careful about asking for\\nthe transforms with now(), because it will not have information yet at this moment in\\ntime, and it cannot be extrapolated into the future, and an exception can be raised.\\nWe can operate with transforms, multiplying them or calculating their inverse.\\nFrom here, we will establish a nomenclature convention in our codes. This will help\\nus to operate with TFs:\\n•If an object represent a transformation from frame origin to frame target,\\nwe call it origin2target.\\n•If want multiply two TFs, as shown in Figure 4.2.\\n1. We only can operate it if the frame names near operator * are equal. In\\nthis case, the frame names are equals (robot).\\n2. The result frame id must be the outer part of the operators (odom from\\nﬁrst operator and object from second).\\n3. If we invert a TF (they are invertibles), we invert the frame ids in this\\nname.\\nwi\\nth ROS2'),\n",

This example will establish some\\nknowledge about visual markers and introduce some test-driven development method-\\nology.\\nSecond, we will see reactive tracking behavior based on information from the\\ncamera.

This\\nsimple algorithm is based on using three 2D vectors to calculate the control speed:\\n•Attractive vector: This vector always points forward since the robot wants\\nto move in a straight line in the absence of obstacles.\\n•Repulsive vector: This vector is calculated from the laser sensor readings. In\\nour basic version, the obstacle closest to the robot produces a repulsion vector,\\ninversely proportional to its distance.\\n1https://github.com/fmrico/cascade lifecycle\\n2https://github.com/fmrico/rqt cascade hfsm\\nDOI: 10.1201/9781003289623-5 81'),\n",

This strategy has several\\nadvantages:\\n•Ensure that once a part of the software has been tested, other parts’ changes\\ndo not negatively aﬀect what has already been developed. The tests are incre-\\nmental. All tests are always passed, assessing the new functionality and the\\nvalidity of previously existing code, making development faster.\\n•The revision task is greatly simpliﬁed if the package receives contributions\\nfrom other developers. Activating a CI (Continous Integration) system in your\\nrepository allows that each contribution has to compile correctly and pass all\\nthe tests, both functional and stylish. In this way, the reviewer focuses on\\nverifying that the code does its job correctly.\\n•Many quality assurance procedures require the software to be tested. Saying “I\\nwill do the tests when I ﬁnish” is a fallacy: You will not do them , or it will be a\\ntedious process that will not help you, so they are likely to be incomplete and\\nineﬀective.\\nROS2 provides many testing tools that we can use easily.

Images provide\\nmore complex perceptual information from which a lot of information can be\\nextracted. Remember that there is an essential part of Artiﬁcial Intelligence\\nthat deals with Artiﬁcial Vision, and it is one of the primary sensors in robots.\\nWe will show how to process these images with OpenCV, the reference library\\nin this area.\\n•Control at joint level: In the previous projects, the commands were speeds\\nsent to the robot. In this case, we will see how to command positions directly\\nto the joints of the robot’s neck.\\n•Lifecycle Nodes: ROS2 provides a particular type of Node called Lifecycle\\nNode. This node is very useful to control the life cycle, including its startup,\\nactivation, and deactivation.\\n5.2.1 Perception and Actuation Models\\nThis project uses the images from the robot’s camera as a source of information.\\nWhenever a node transmits an (non-compressed) image in ROS2 it uses the same\\ntype of message: sensor\\nmsgs/msg/Image. All the drivers of all cameras supported\\nin ROS2 use it. See what the message format is:'),\n",

The reason is that each node\\n(ObjectDetector and HeadController) can be executed separately, and be reused\\nin other problems (we will do it in next chapters). Each one has been designed in\\nthis way to be reusable, with inputs and outputs that try to be generic, not strongly\\ncoupled to this problem.\\nIn this Computation Graph, theHeadController has been represented diﬀerently\\nfrom the rest of the nodes. This node will be implemented asLifeCycle Node, which\\nwe will explain in the Section 5.2.3. For now, we will say that it is like a standard\\nnode but that it can be activated and deactivated during its operation.\\nThe HeadController receives a pan/tilt speed, each in the range [ −1,1]. Note\\nthat since there is no standard ROS2 message that ﬁts our problem (we could have\\nused geometry\\nmsgs/msg/Pose2D, ignoring the ﬁeld theta), we have created a custom\\nbr2 tracking msgs/msg/PanTiltCommand message containing the needed informa-\\ntion. We will see below how we have done to create our custom message.\\nThe ObjectDetector publishes, for each image, the result of the detection of the\\nfurniture in the image. It will return the coordinate, in pixels, of the detection, as\\nwell as the bounding box of the object.\\nThe output of the ObjectDetector does not completely match the input of the\\nHeadController. ObjectDetector publishes its output in pixels. In this case, the\\nimage resolution is 640 ×480 so its range is [0, 640] for the horizontal X component\\nand [0,480] for the vertical Y component. Therefore, we create a node, tracker, with\\na straightforward task, which is to adapt the output of the ObjectDetector to the\\ninput of the HeadController, to make a control in the image, moving the head so\\nthat the detected object is always in the center of the image.\\nwith ROS2'),\n",

They have been used in various applications, mainly in video games and\\nrobots. They are usually compared to ﬁnite state machines, but the reality is that\\nthey are diﬀerent approximations. When developing robotic behaviors with (Finite\\nState Machines) FSMs, we think about states and transitions. When we use Behavior\\nTrees, we think of sequences, fallbacks, and many ﬂow resources that give them great\\nexpressiveness. In this chapter, as an illustrative example, we will implement the\\nBump and Go that we did with FSMs in the Chapter 3, and we will see how much\\nthe two approaches diﬀer.\\n6.1 BEHAVIOR TREES\\nA Behavior Tree (BT) is a mathematical model to encode the control of a system.\\nA BT is a way to structure the switching between diﬀerent tasks in an autonomous\\nagent, such as a robot or a virtual entity in a computer game. It is a hierarchical data\\nstructure deﬁned recursively from a root node with several child nodes. Each child\\nnode, in turn, can have more children, and so on. Nodes that do not have children\\nare usually called leaves of the tree.\\nThe basic operation of a node is the tick. When a node is ticked, it can return\\nthree diﬀerent values:\\n•SUCCESS: The node has completed its mission successfully.\\n•FAILURE: The node has failed in its mission.\\n•RUNNING: The node has not yet completed its mission.\\nA BT has four diﬀerent types of nodes:\\nDOI: 10.1201/9781003289623-6\\n115'),\n",

It is important to note that multiple diﬀerent Behavior Trees can be\\ncreated with the same nodes. If the nodes have been designed suﬃciently gen-\\nerally, in this phase, very diﬀerent behaviors of the robot can be deﬁned using\\nthe same nodes.\\nA Behavior Tree has a blackboard, a key/value storage that all nodes in a tree\\ncan access. Nodes can have input ports and output ports to exchange information\\nbetween them. The output ports of one node are connected to the input ports of\\nanother node using a key from the blackboard. While the ports of the nodes (their\\ntype and port class) have to be known at compile-time, the connections are established\\nat deployment-time.\\nFigure 6.4 shows an example of connecting nodes through ports. A DetectObject\\naction node is in charge of detecting some object so that the InformHuman node com-\\nmunicates it to the robot operator. DetectObject uses its output port detected\\nid\\nto send the identiﬁer of the detected object to InformHuman through its port\\nobject id. For this, they use the input of the blackborad whose key objID currently\\nhas the value cup. Using keys from the blackboard is not mandatory. At deployment\\ntime, the value could be a constant value.\\nBehavior Trees are speciﬁed in XML. Although editing tools such as Groot 1 are\\nused, they generate a BT in XML format. If this BT is saved to disk and this ﬁle\\nis loaded from an application, any change to the BT does not require recompiling.\\nThe format is easy to understand, and it is widespread for BTs to be designed di-\\nrectly in XML. The following code shows two equally valid alternatives for the BT in\\nFigure 6.1.\\n1https://github.com/BehaviorTree/Groot\\nwith ROS2'),\n",

A program should build a tree and start\\nticking its root until it returns SUCCESS. Behavior trees are created using a\\nBehaviorTreeFactory, specifying an XML ﬁle or directly a string that contains\\nthe XML. BehaviorTreeFactory needs to load the libraries of the custom nodes as\\nplugins and needs the blackboard to be shared among the BT nodes.\\nTo integrate behavior trees with ROS2, create a ROS2 node and put it on the\\nblackboard. As shown before, BT nodes can extract it from the blackboard to create\\npublishers/subscribers or clients/servers of services or actions. Along with the tick at\\nthe root of the tree, a spin\\nsome manages the arrival of messages to the ROS2 node.\\nSee how it looks like the program that carries out the tree creation and execution:\\nsrc/mr2 bt bumpgo/isObstacle.cpp\\nint main(int argc, char * argv[])\\n{\\nrclcpp::init(argc, argv);\\nauto node = rclcpp::Node::make_shared(\"patrolling_node\");\\nBT::BehaviorTreeFactory factory;\\nBT::SharedLibrary loader;\\nfactory.registerFromPlugin(loader.getOSName(\"br2_forward_bt_node\"));\\nfactory.registerFromPlugin(loader.getOSName(\"br2_back_bt_node\"));\\nfactory.registerFromPlugin(loader.getOSName(\"br2_turn_bt_node\"));\\nfactory.registerFromPlugin(loader.getOSName(\"br2_is_obstacle_bt_node\"));\\nstd::string pkgpath = ament_index_cpp::get_package_share_directory(\"br2_bt_bumpgo\");\\nstd::string xml_file = pkgpath + \"/behavior_tree_xml/bumpgo.xml\";'),\n",

Upon reach-\\ning each waypoint, the robot turns on itself for a few seconds to perceive its\\nsurroundings.\\n•While the robot goes from one waypoint to another, the robot perceives and\\ntracks the detected objects.\\n•The robot keeps track (simulated) of the battery level it has.

The Section 6.3.2\\ndescribes the steps to set up Nav2 for a particular robot and environment. It is\\npossible to skip this section since the br2\\nnavigation package already contains the\\nenvironment map and conﬁguration ﬁles for the simulated Tiago scenario in the\\nhouse.

Nav2 incorporates multiple plugins for local and global\\nnavigation and allows custom plugins to be easily used.\\nThe inputs to Nav2 are TF transformations (conforming to REP-105), a map 5,\\nany relevant sensor data sources.

The Behav-\\nior Tree nodes make requests to the other components of Nav2 so that they\\ncarry out their task.\\nWhen this component accepts a navigation action, it starts executing a Be-\\nhavior Tree like the one shown in Figure 6.17.

It is useless for a robot to be\\na mechanical prodigy without providing it with software that processes the\\ninformation from the sensors to send the correct commands to the actuators to fulﬁll\\nthe mission for which it was created. This chapter introduces the middlewares for\\nprogramming robots and, in particular, to ROS2[8], which will be the one used in\\nthis book.\\nFirst of all, nobody starts programming a robot from scratch. Robot software is\\nvery complex since we have to face the problem that a robot performs tasks in a real,\\ndynamic, and sometimes unpredictable world. It also must deal with a wide variety\\nof models and types of sensors and actuators. Implementing the necessary drivers or\\nadapting to new hardware components is a titanic eﬀort doomed to failure.\\nMiddleware is a layer of software between the operating system and user appli-\\ncations to carry out the programming of applications in some domains. Middleware\\nusually contains more than libraries, including development and monitoring tools, and\\na development methodology. Figure 1.1 shows a schematic of a system that includes\\nmiddleware for developing applications for robots.\\nRobot programming middlewares provide drivers, libraries, and methodologies.\\nThey also usually oﬀer development, integration, execution, and monitoring tools.\\nThroughout the history of Robotics, a multitude of robot programming middlewares\\nhave emerged. Few of them have survived the robot for which they were designed or\\nhave expanded from the laboratories where they were implemented. There are no-\\ntable examples (Yarp[5], Carmen[6], Player/Stage[2], etc), although without a doubt\\nthe most successful in the last decade has been ROS[7], which is currently considered\\nRobot/Computer Hardware\\nOperating System\\nMiddleware for Robots\\nRobotic\\nApplication Tools\\nOther\\nApplications\\nFigure 1.1: Representation of software layers in a robot.\\nDOI: 10.1201/9781003289623-1 1'),\n",

Technically, there are similarities\\nbetween the diﬀerent middlewares: most are based on Open Source, many provide\\ncommunication mechanisms for distributed components, compilation systems, mon-\\nitoring tools, etc. The big diﬀerence is the ROS developers community around the\\nworld. There are also leading companies, international organizations, and universi-\\nties worldwide in this community, providing a vast collection of software, drivers,\\ndocumentation, or questions already resolved to almost any problem that may arise.\\nRobotics can been deﬁned as “the art of integration”, and ROS oﬀers a lot of software\\nto integrate, as well as the tools to do so.\\nThis book will provide the skills necessary to undertake projects in ROS2, the\\nnew version of ROS. It is unnecessary to have previous experience in ROS2 since we\\nwill describe its concepts, tools, and methodologies from the beginning without the\\nneed of previous experience. We will assume average Linux and programming skills.\\nWe will use the two programming languages oﬃcially supported in ROS2 (C++ and\\nPython), which coincide with the languages most used in general in Robotics.\\n1.1 ROS2 OVERVIEW\\nThe meaning of the acronym ROS is Robot Operating System. It is not an operating\\nsystem that replaces Linux or Windows but a middleware that increases the system’s\\ncapabilities to develop Robotic applications. The number 2 indicates that it is the\\nsecond generation of this middleware. The reader who already knows the ﬁrst version\\nof ROS (sometimes referred to as ROS1) will ﬁnd many similar concepts, and there\\nare already several teaching resources1 for the ROS1 programmer who lands on ROS2.\\nIn this book, we will assume no previous knowledge of ROS. It will be more and more\\ncommon for this to happen, as there are now more and more reasons to learn ROS2\\ndirectly instead of going through ROS1 ﬁrst.\\nAlso, there are already some excellent oﬃcial ROS2 tutorials, so the approach\\nin this book is intended to be diﬀerent. The description will be complete and with\\na methodology oriented to developing robotic applications that make the robot do\\nsomething “smart”, from robotic engineer to robotic engineer, emphasizing essential\\nissues that come from experience in the development of software in robots. It will not\\nhurt for the reader to explore the tutorials available to complete their training and\\nﬁll in the gaps that do not ﬁt in this book:\\n•Oﬃcial ROS2 tutorials: https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials.html\\n•The Robotics Back-End tutorials: https://roboticsbackend.com/category/ros2/\\n•ROS2 for ROS2 developers:https://github.com/fmrico/ros to ros2 talk examples\\nThe starting point is a Linux Ubuntu 20.04 LTS system installed on a computer\\nwith an AMD64-bit architecture, the most extended one in a personal laptop or\\ndesktop computer.

Each distribution has a name and\\nis linked to a version of Ubuntu. The software in a distribution is also guaranteed\\nto work correctly with the software version present on the system. It is possible\\nto use another Linux distribution (Ubuntu, Fedora, Red Hat ...), but the reference\\nis Ubuntu. ROS2 also works on Windows and Mac, but this document focuses on\\nLinux development. We will use the ROS2 Foxy Fitzroy version, which corresponds\\nto Ubuntu 20.04.\\nIn this book, we will approach ROS2 from three diﬀerent but complementary\\ndimensions:\\n•The Community: The ROS community is a fundamental element when de-\\nveloping applications for robots with this middleware. In addition to providing\\ntechnical documentation, there is a vast community of developers who con-\\ntribute with their own applications and utilities through public repositories, to\\nwhich other developers can contribute. Another member of the community may\\nhave already developed something you need.\\n•Computation Graph: The Computational Graph is a running ROS2 appli-\\ncation. This graph is made up of nodes and arcs. The Node, the primary com-\\nputing units in ROS2, can collaborate with other nodes using several diﬀerent\\ncommunication paradigms to compose a ROS2 application. This dimension also\\naddresses the monitoring tools, which are also nodes that are inserted in this\\ngraph.\\n•The Workspace: The Workspace is the set of software installed on the robot\\nor computer, and the programs that the user develops. In contrast to the Com-\\nputational Graph, which has a dynamic nature, the Workspace is static. This\\ndimension also addresses the development tools to build the elements of the\\nComputational Graph.\\n1.1.1 The ROS Community\\nThe ﬁrst dimension of ROS2 to consider is the ROS Community. The Open Source\\nRobotics Foundation2 greatly enhanced the community of users and developers. ROS2\\nis not only a robot programming middleware, but it is also a development methodol-\\nogy, a established software delivery mechanisms, and a set of resources made available\\nto members of the ROS community.\\nROS2 is fundamentally Open Source, which means that it is software released\\nunder a license in which the user has rights of use, study, change, and redistribu-\\ntion. Many Open Source licenses modulate certain freedoms on this software, but\\nessentially we can assume these rights. The most common licenses for ROS2 software\\npackages are Apache 2 and BSD, although developers are free to use others.\\nROS2 organizes the software following a federal model, providing the technical\\nmechanisms that make it possible. Each developer, company, or institution can de-\\nvelop their software freely, responsible for managing it. It is also widespread that small\\n2https://www.openrobotics.org'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\A Concise Introduction to Robot Programming with ROS2.pdf'}, page_content='projects create a community around it, and this community can organize decision-\\nmaking on releasing issues. These entities create software packages for ROS2 that\\nthey can make available in public repositories or be part of a ROS2 distribution as\\nbinaries. Nobody can force these entities to migrate their software to new versions\\nof ROS2. However, the inertia of many essential and popular packages is enough to\\nguarantee their continuity.\\nThe importance of this development modeling is that it fosters the growth of the\\nROS community. From a practical point of view, this is key to the success of a robot\\nprogramming middleware. One of the desirable characteristics of this type of middle-\\nware is its support for many sensors and actuators. Nowadays, many manufacturers\\nof these components oﬃcially support their drivers for ROS2 since they know that\\nthere are many potential customers and that there are many developers who check\\nif a speciﬁc component is supported in ROS2 before buying them. In addition, these\\ncompanies usually develop this software in open repositories where users communi-\\nties can be created reporting bugs and even sending their patches. If you want your\\nlibrary or tool for robots to be widely used, supporting ROS2 may be the way.\\nThe packages in ROS2 are organized in distributions. A ROS2 distribution is\\nmade up of a multitude of packages that can work well together. Usually, this implies\\nthat it is tied to a speciﬁc version of a base system. ROS2 uses Ubuntu Linux versions\\nas reference. This guarantees stability since otherwise, the dependencies of versions\\nof diﬀerent packages and libraries would make ROS2 a real mess. When an entity\\nreleases speciﬁc software, it does so for a given distribution. It is common to maintain\\nmultiple development branches for each distribution.\\nROS2 has released a total of seven distributions to date (January’22), which we\\ncan see in Figure 1.2 . Each distribution has a name whose initial increases and a\\ndiﬀerent logo (and a diﬀerent T-shirt model!). An eighth distribution, which is a bit\\nspecial, called Rolling Ridley, serves as a staging area for future stable distributions\\nof ROS2 and as a collection of the most recent development releases.\\nDistro name Release Data EOL date Ubuntu version\\nGalactic Geochelone May 23rd, 2021 November 2022\\nFoxy Fitzroy June 5th, 2020 May 2023 (LTS) Ubuntu 20.04\\nEloquent Elusor November 22nd, 2019 November 2020\\nDashing Diademata May 31st, 2019 May 2021 (LTS)\\nCrystal Clemmys December 14th, 2018 December 2019\\nUbuntu 18.04\\nBouncy Bolson July 2nd, 2018 July 2019\\nArdent Apalone December 8th, 2017 December 2018 Ubuntu 16.04\\nIf you want to contribute your software to a distribution, you should visit the\\nrosdistro repository (https://github.com/ros/rosdistro), and a couple of useful links:\\n•Contributing: https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/master/\\nCONTRIBUTING.md\\n•Releasing your package: https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/How-To-Guides/\\nReleasing/Releasing-a-Package.html\\n4 ■ A Concise Introduction to Robot Programming with ROS2'),\n",

This vision will give us an idea of the goal, and we will be able to\\nunderstand better the why of many of the contents that will follow. This dimension\\nis what we call Computation Graph.\\nA Computation Graph contains ROS2 nodes that communicate with each other\\nso that the robot can carry out some tasks. The logic of the application is in the\\nnodes, as the primary elements of execution in ROS2.'),\n",

A node is an object\\nof class Node, in general, whether it is written in C++ or Python.\\nA node can access the Computation Graph and provides mechanisms to commu-\\nnicate with other nodes through 3 types of paradigms:\\n•Publication/Subscription: It is an asynchronous communication, where N\\nnodes publish messages to a topic that reaches its M subscribers. A topic is like\\na communication channel that accepts messages of a unique type. This type\\nof communication is the most common in ROS2. A very representative case is\\nthe node that contains the driver of a camera that publishes images in a topic.\\nAll the nodes in a system needing images from the camera to carry out their\\nfunction subscribe to this topic.\\n•Services: It is a synchronous communication in which a node requests another\\nnode and waits for the response. This communication usually requires an im-\\nmediate response so as not to aﬀect the control cycle of the node that calls\\nthe service. An example could be the request to the mapping service to reset a\\nmap, with a response indicating if the call succeeded.\\n•Actions: These are asynchronous communications in which a node makes a\\nrequest to another node. These requests usually take time to complete, and the\\ncalling node may periodically receive feedback or the notiﬁcation that it has ﬁn-\\nished successfully or with some error. A navigation request is an example of this\\ntype of communication. This request is possibly time-consuming, whereby the\\nnode requesting the robot to navigate should not be blocked while completing.\\nThe function of a node in a computational graph is to perform processing or\\ncontrol. Therefore, they are considered active elements with some alternatives in\\nterms of their execution model:\\n•Iterative execution: It is popular in the control software for a node to execute\\nits control cycle at a speciﬁc frequency. This approach allows controlling how\\nmany computational resources a node requires, and the output ﬂow remains\\nconstant. For example, a node calculating motion commands to actuators at\\n20 Hz based on their status.\\n•Event-oriented execution: The execution of these nodes is determined by the\\nfrequency at which certain events occur, in this case, the arrival of messages\\nat this node. For example, a node that, for each image it receives, performs\\ndetection on it and produces an output. The frequency at which an output\\noccurs depends on the frequency at which images arrive. If no images reach it,\\nit produces no output.\\nNext, we will show several examples of computational graphs.

Its functionality is exposed to the user through various\\ntopics. In this case, we have shown only two topics:\\n•/mobile\\nbase/event/bumper: It is a topic in which the kobuki driver pub-\\nlishes a kobuki msgs/msg/BumperEvent message every time one of the bumpers\\nchanges state (whether or not it is pressed). All nodes of the system interested\\non detecting collision with this sensor subscribe to this topic.\\n•/mobile\\nbase/commands/velocity: It is a topic to which the kobuki driver\\nsubscribes to adjust its speed.

When creating a resource, for example, a publisher, we can specify its name relative,\\nabsolute (begins with “/”), or privately (begins with “ ∼”). Furthermore, we can deﬁne\\na namespace whose objective is to isolate resources from other namespaces by adding the\\nworkspace’s name as the ﬁrst component of the name. Namespaces are helpful, for example,\\nin multirobot applications. Let’s see an example of the resulting name of a topic based on\\nthe node name and the namespace:\\nname Result: (node: my node / ns: none) Result: (node: my node / ns: my ns)\\nmy topic /my topic /my ns/my topic\\n/my topic /my topic /my topic\\n∼my topic /my node/my topic /my ns/my node/my topic\\nFurther readings:\\n• http://wiki.ros.org/Names\\n• https://design.ros2.org/articles/topic and service names.html\\nThis node runs inside a separate process. The Computation Graph shows another\\nprocess that subscribes to the bumper’s topic, and based on the information it re-\\nceives, it publishes the speed at which the robot should move. We have set the node’s\\nexecution frequency to indicate that it makes a control decision at 10 Hz, whether or\\nnot it receives messages about the status of the bumper.\\nThis Computation Graph comprises two nodes and two topics, with their respec-\\ntive publication/subscription connections.\\nLet’s evolve the robot and the application. Let’s add a laser and a 3D camera (also\\ncalled RGBD camera). For each sensor, a node must access the sensor and present it\\nwith a ROS2 interface. As we said earlier, publishing the data from a sensor is the\\nmost convenient way to make this data available in a computational graph.\\nThe application now makes the robot move towards people or objects detected\\nfrom the 3D image of an RGBD camera. A laser sensor avoids colliding as we move.\\nThe Computation Graph shown in Figure 1.5 summarizes the application:\\n•The control node runs at 20 Hz sending control commands to the robot base.\\nIt subscribes to the topic /scan to check the obstacles around it.\\n•The process contains two nodes that detect people and objects, respectively.\\nBoth need the image and depth information from the camera to determine the\\nposition of detected objects. Each detection is published in two diﬀerent topics,\\nusing a standard message designed for 3D detection.\\n•The control node subscribes to these topics to carry out its task.\\nIn the last example, the robot used is Tiago 4. Let’s assume that there is only one\\nnode that provides its functionality. We use in this example two subscribers (speed\\ncommands to move its base and trajectory commands to move its neck) and two\\npublishers (laser information and the 3D image from a RGBD camera).\\n4https://pal-robotics.com/es/robots/tiago/\\nwith ROS2'),\n",

There is behavior coordinator (Coordinator) and a node\\nthat implements an active vision system (HeadController). Coordinator de-\\ntermines where to look at and which points the robot should visit on a map.\\n•Navigation Subsystem: This example of a navigation subsystem consists of\\nseveral nodes. The navigation manager coordinates the planner (in charge of\\ncreating routes from the robot’s position to the destination) and the controller\\n(which makes the robot follow the created route). The planner needs the map\\nprovided by a node that loads the environment map and the robot’s position\\nthat calculates a location node.\\n•Communication between both subsystems is done using ROS2 actions. The\\nNavigation Behavior sets a goal and is notiﬁed when it is complete. It also\\nperiodically receives progress toward the destination. Actions are also used to\\ncoordinate the planner and controller within the navigation system.\\nThroughout this subsection, we have shown computation graphs. Every time we\\nimplement an application in ROS2, we design a computational graph. We establish\\nwhich nodes we need and what their interactions are. We must decide if a node is\\nexecuted at a speciﬁc frequency or if some event causes its execution (request or\\nmessage). We can develop all the nodes, or include in the Computation Graph nodes\\ndeveloped by third parties.'),\n",

This includes the build system\\nand node startup tools.\\nThe fundamental element in this dimension is the package. A package contains\\nexecutables, libraries, or message deﬁnitions with a common purpose. Usually, a pack-\\nage depends on other packages to run or be built.\\nAnother element of this dimension is the workspace itself. A workspace is a di-\\nrectory that contains packages. This workspace has to be activated so that what it\\ncontains is available to use.\\nwith ROS2'),\n",

This activation process\\nis accumulative. We can activate an initial workspace, that we call underlay. Later,\\nwe can activate another workspace that we will call overlay because it overlays the\\nprevious underlay workspace. The overlay package dependencies should be satisﬁed\\nin the underlay. If a package in the overlay already exists in the underlay, the overlay\\npackage hides the one in the underlay.\\nUsually, the workspace containing the basic ROS2 installation is activated ini-\\ntially. This is the most common underlay in a ROS2 system. Then, the workspace,\\nwhere the user is developing their own packages, is activated.\\nPackages can be installed from sources or with the system installation system.\\nOn Ubuntu Linux 20.04, which is the reference in this book, it is carried out with deb\\npackages using tools like apt. Each ROS2 package is packaged in a deb package. The\\nnames of deb packages in a distribution are easily identiﬁable because their names\\nstart with ros-<distro>-<ros2 package name>. In order to access these packages,\\nconﬁgure the APT ROS2 repository:\\n$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl gnupg2 lsb-release\\n$ sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key\\n-o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg\\n$ echo \"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture)\\nsigned-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg]\\nhttp://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(source /etc/os-release && echo\\n$UBUNTU CODENAME) main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null\\n$ sudo apt-get update\\nOf course, the installation dependencies of the Deb packages are those of the ROS2\\npackage. The following command shows the ROS2 packages available to install:\\n$ apt-cache search ros-foxy\\nROS2 Foxy installation. Instructions are located athttps://docs.ros.org/\\nen/foxy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html. Basically, ROS2 Foxy is\\ninstalled just typing:\\n$ sudo apt update\\n$ sudo apt install ros-foxy-desktop\\nAll the ROS2 software installed by apt is in /opt/ros/foxy. On an Ubuntu\\n20.04 system, installing the ROS2 Galactic version or the ROS Noetic Ninjemys\\nversion is also possible. If both are installed, they are in /opt/ros/galactic and\\n/opt/ros/noetic, respectively. We could even install one of these ROS distributions\\nby compiling its source code in some other location. Because of this, and because it is\\nnot recommended (unless you know what you are doing) to mix ROS distributions,\\ninstalling a distribution does not “activate” it. The activation is done by executing\\nin a terminal:\\n$ source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash'),\n",

This tool discov-\\ners dependencies not satisﬁed in a set of source packages and installs them as deb\\npackages. We only need to run these commands once after installation:\\n$ sudo rosdep init\\n$ rosdep update\\nTypically, the user creates a directory in his $HOME directory that contains the\\nsources of the packages he is developing.

Packages are those that have a package.xml ﬁle in their\\nroot directory.\\nIn this workspace, there are many packages with dependencies on other packages\\nnot part of the ROS2 Foxy distribution. To add the sources of these packages to the\\nworkspace, we will use the vcstool6:\\n$ cd ∼/bookros2 ws/src\\n$ vcs import . < book ros2/third parties.repos\\nThe command vcs reads a list of repositories from a .repos ﬁle and clones them\\ninto the speciﬁed directory.

This\\ndiscovery is made using multicast, although subsequent connections are unicast.\\nThere are several DDS vendors, including FastDDS 13, CycloneDDS14, or RTI 15\\nConnext. All of them fully or partially implement the DDS standard deﬁned by the\\nOMG16. ROS2 can use all of these DDS implementations. Very few ROS2 developers\\ncould notice when using one or the other. Still, when we begin to require high per-\\nformance in latency, amount of data, or resources used, we can ﬁnd some diﬀerences\\nthat make us choose one with objective criteria.\\nThe APIs of these DDS implementations do not have to be the same. In fact, they\\nare not. For this reason, and to simplify the rcl layer, an underlying layer called rmw\\nhas been implemented, which presents the rcl programmer with a uniﬁed API to ac-\\ncess the functionality of each supported DDS implementation. Selecting which DDS to\\nuse is trivial, requiring just modifying an environment variable,RMW\\nIMPLEMENTATION.\\nThe oﬃcial version of DDS in the Foxy distribution is FastDDS, while in Galactic,\\nit is CycloneDDS. These vendors compete (in what ironically came to be called the\\nDDS Wars) to be the predominant implementation. Hopefully, the main beneﬁciary\\nof this competition will be the ROS2 community.\\n1.3 ABOUT THIS BOOK\\nThis book is intended to be a journey through programming robots in ROS2, present-\\ning several projects where the main ROS2 concepts are applied. Prior knowledge of\\nROS/ROS2 is not needed. Many of the concepts we will see will sound very familiar\\nto ROS1 programmers. They will ﬁnd interesting the changes that ROS2 presents\\nconcerning the previous version.\\nWe will use C++ as a vehicular language, although we will include one in Python\\nin our ﬁrst examples. We can develop complex and powerful projects in Python but\\nin my experience with robots, I prefer to use a compiled language rather than an\\ninterpreted one. Similarly, the concepts explained with C++ are equally valid with\\nPython. Another decision is to use Linux (speciﬁcally Ubuntu GNU / Linux 20.04\\nLTS) instead of Windows or Mac since it is the reference platform in ROS2 and the\\none that I consider predominant in Robotics.\\nI will assume that the reader is a motivated engineering student or an experi-\\nmented engineer/professional. We will be using many C++ features up to C++17, in-\\ncluding smart pointers (shared\\nptr and unique ptr), containers (vector, list, map),\\ngeneric programming, and more. I will try to explain complex code parts from a\\nlanguage point of view, but the less advanced reader may need to consult some ref-\\nerences17,18. I also count on the reader to know CMake, Git, gdb, and other common\\ntools developers use in Linux environments. It can be a great time to learn it if you\\n13https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS\\n14https://github.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds\\n15https://www.rti.com/products/dds-standard\\n16https://www.omg.org/\\n17https://en.cppreference.com/w/\\n18https://www.cplusplus.com/'),\n",

This book wants to teach ROS2 by applying concepts\\nto examples in which a simulated robot performs some mission. Also, we want to\\nteach not only ROS2 but also some general concepts in Robotics and how they are\\napplied in ROS2.\\nTherefore, in this book, we will analyze much code.

You can conﬁgure the logger to establish another minimum\\nlevel of severity to be displayed on the standard output:\\n$ ros2 run br2 basics logger --ros-args --log-level debug\\nWhen there are many nodes in an application, it is recommended to use tools such as\\nrqt\\nconsole that allows selecting nodes and severities.\\nFurther readings:\\n• https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Logging-and-logger-conﬁguration.html\\n• https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Concepts/About-Logging.html\\nThe second strategy to iteratively execute a task can be seen in the\\nsrc/logger class.cpp program. In addition, we show something widespread in\\nROS2, which is to implement the nodes inheriting from rclcpp::Node. This ap-\\nproach allows to have a cleaner code and opens the door to many possibilities that\\nwill be shown later:\\nsrc/logger class.cpp\\nclass LoggerNode : public rclcpp::Node\\n{\\npublic:\\nLoggerNode() : Node(\"logger_node\")\\n{\\ncounter_ = 0;\\ntimer_ = create_wall_timer(\\n500ms, std::bind(&LoggerNode::timer_callback, this));\\n}\\nvoid timer_callback()\\n{\\nRCLCPP_INFO(get_logger(), \"Hello %d\", counter_++);\\n}\\nprivate:\\nrclcpp::TimerBase::SharedPtr timer_;\\nint counter_;\\n};\\nint main(int argc, char * argv[]) {\\nrclcpp::init(argc, argv);\\nauto node = std::make_shared<LoggerNode>();\\nrclcpp::spin(node);\\nrclcpp::shutdown();\\nreturn 0;\\n}\\nA timer controls the control loop. This timer produces an event at the desired\\nfrequency. When this event happens, it calls the callback that handles it.

Just as ros2 run completed with the programs\\navailable in a package, ros2 launch does the same with the available launchers.\\nFrom an implementation point of view, a launcher is a python pro-\\ngram that contains a generate launch description() function that returns a\\nLaunchDescription object.

When your program need\\nconﬁguration ﬁles, use parameters. These parameters can be boolean, integer, string,\\nor arrays of any of these types. Parameters are read at run time, usually when a node\\nstarts, and their operation depends on these values.\\nImagine that a node is in charge of locating a robot using a Particle Filter [9 ] and\\nrequires several parameters, such as a maximum number of particles or the topics\\nfrom which to receive sensory information.

Why is the conﬁg directory and not set up or\\nstartup instead of launch? And why put the source ﬁle in another structure? Why\\nuse YAML/parameters and not text ﬁles or XML and a custom conﬁguration reader?\\nWhy use launchers and not a bash script? And why not an application that launches\\nall the necessary nodes?\\nOf course, a ROS2 developer could make other decisions, but there is a general\\nagreement on doing things. This agreement has the advantage that when another\\ndeveloper tries to use your code, it is much easier to ﬁnd and identify the critical\\nelements. My recommendation is to follow these conventions. This way, your code\\ncan be used by more people, it will be more maintainable in the long term, and\\nreceive more collaborations. A company will make this more critical because it will\\nbe easier to inherit software when incorporating or replacing developers.\\nContinue with our example. A ﬁle with the parameters with our node could look\\nlike this:\\nconfig/params.yaml\\nlocalization_node:\\nros__parameters:\\nnumber_particles: 300\\ntopics: [scan, image]\\ntopic_types: [sensor_msgs/msg/LaserScan, sensor_msgs/msg/Image]\\nAnd execute indicating specifying the location of our ﬁle.

Another beneﬁt is that it can simplify the deployment of nodes if they\\nare all in the same program. The drawback is that a failure in one node could cause\\nall nodes of the same process to terminate.\\nROS2 oﬀers you several ways to run multiple nodes in the same process. The most\\nrecommended is to make use of the Executors. An Executor is an object to which\\nnodes are added to execute them together. See an example:\\nSingle thread executor\\nint main(int argc, char * argv[]) {\\nrclcpp::init(argc, argv);\\nauto node_pub = std::make_shared<PublisherNode>();\\nauto node_sub = std::make_shared<SubscriberNode>();\\nrclcpp::executors::SingleThreadedExecutor executor;\\nexecutor.add_node(node_pub);\\nexecutor.add_node(node_sub);\\nexecutor.spin();\\nrclcpp::shutdown();\\nreturn 0;\\n}\\nMulti thread executor\\nauto node_pub = std::make_shared<PublisherNode>();\\nauto node_sub = std::make_shared<SubscriberNode>();\\nrclcpp::executors::MultiThreadedExecutor executor(\\nrclcpp::executor::ExecutorArgs(), 8);\\nexecutor.add_node(node_pub);\\nexecutor.add_node(node_sub);\\nexecutor.spin();\\n}\\nIn both codes, we create an executor to which we add the two nodes (Figure 2.10)\\nso that the spin call handles both nodes. The diﬀerence between the two is using a\\nsingle thread for this management, or using eight threads to optimize the processor\\ncapabilities.\\n/publisher_node\\n2 Hz\\n/int_topic\\nstd_msgs/msg/Int32\\n/subscriber_node\\nFigure 2.10: Computation Graph for the Publisher and Subscriber nodes, running\\nin the same process.\\nwith ROS2'),\n",

The frames usually appear at points on\\nthe robot subject to variation, as in the case of the motors joining the robot’s parts.\\nROS2 has a system called TF, which we will explain in next chapters, which\\nmaintains these relationships through two topics /tf, for geometric transformations\\nthat vary, and /tf static if they are ﬁxed.\\nROS2 has several tools that help us display sensory and geometric information,\\nand perhaps the most popular is RViz2. Start by running it by typing in a terminal:\\n$ ros2 run rviz2 rviz2\\nRViz2 is a viewer that allows to display information contained in the topics. If\\nthis is your ﬁrst time opening RViz2, it will probably appear quite empty; only a grid\\nthrough which we can navigate using the keys and the mouse. We will discover the\\ninformation about our robot step by step, as shown in Figure 2.13:\\n1. On the left, in the Displays panel, RViz2 has some global options in which we\\nhave to specify what our Fixed Frame is, that is, the coordinate axis of the 3D vi-\\nsualization shown on the right.

In the Displays Panel, we are going to add diﬀerent visualizations. The ﬁrst will\\nbe to see the frames of the robot. Press the Add button, and look in the “By\\ndisplay type” tab, the TF element. All the robot frames will appear instantly.\\nIf they seem like a lot to you, display the TF component in the Displays Panel,\\nuncheck the “All Enabled” box and start adding or removing the frames you\\nwant.\\n3.

This exercise will put together many things we have pre-\\nsented and show how eﬀective it is to program a robot using ROS2. In addition, we\\nwill address some issues in robot programming.\\nThe Bump and Go behavior uses the robot’s sensor to detect nearby obstacles\\nin front of the robot. The robot moves forward, and when it detects an obstacle, it\\ngoes back and turns for a ﬁxed time to move forward again. Although it is a simple\\nbehavior, some decision-making approach is recommended since our code, even if it\\nis simple, can start to grow out of order as we solve the problems that may arise. In\\nthis case, we will use a Finite State Machine (FSM).\\nAn FSM is a mathematical computational model that we can use to deﬁne the\\nbehavior of a robot. It is made up of states and transitions. A robot keeps producing\\nan output in one state until the condition of an outgoing transition is fulﬁlled and it\\ntransits to the target state of this transition.\\nApplying an FSM can signiﬁcantly reduce the complexity of solving a problem\\nwhen we implement simple behaviors. For a moment, try to think about how to\\napproach the Bump and Go problem using loops, ifs, temporary variables, counters,\\ntimers. It would be a complex program to understand and follow its logic. Once\\nﬁnished, adding some additional conditions will probably make to throw away what\\nwe have done and start over.\\nApplying an FSM-based solution to theBump and Go problem is straightforward.\\nThink about the diﬀerent outputs that the robot must produce (stop, move forward,\\ngo back, and turn). Each of these actions will have its own state. Now think about the\\ntransitions between states (connection and condition), and we will obtain an FSM\\nlike the one shown in Figure 3.1.\\nDOI: 10.1201/9781003289623-3\\n47'),\n",

For diﬀerent\\ndimensions, we will consider the units of meters, seconds, and radians. Linear\\nspeeds should be m/s, rotational speeds rad/s, linear accelerations m/s2, and\\nso on.\\n•In ROS2 we are right-handed (left part of Figure 3.2): x grows forward, y to\\nthe left, and z grows up. If we establish the reference origin on our chest, a\\ncoordinate whose x is negative would be behind us, and a positive z would be\\nabove us.\\n•Angles are deﬁned as rotations around the axes. Rotation aroundxis sometimes\\ncalled the roll, y pitch, and z yaw.\\n•Angles grow by turning to the left (right part ofFigure 3.2). Angle 0 is forward,\\nπ is back, and π/2 is left.\\nIn this problem, we will use the information of the laser sensor, which we saw\\nin the previous chapter that was in the topic /scan\\nraw, and whose type was\\nsensor msgs/msg/LaserScan.

We can use the original frame of the sensor since it\\nis aligned, a little forward and up, with base footprint.\\nAn essential feature of ROS is standardization. Once a consensus has been reached\\nin the community on the format in which the information produced by a laser sensor\\nis encoded, all laser driver developers should use this format. This consensus means\\nthat the message format must be general enough to support any laser sensor. In the\\nsame way, an application developer must exploit the information in this message for\\nhis program to function correctly regardless of the characteristics of the sensor that\\nproduced the sensory reading. The great advantage of this approach is that we can\\nmake any ROS program work with any ROS-supported laser, allowing the software\\nto be truly portable between robots. Also, an experienced ROS developer does not\\nhave to learn new, manufacturer-deﬁned formats. Finally, using this format puts at\\nyour disposal a wide variety of utilities to ﬁlter or monitor laser information. This\\napproach applies to all types of sensors and actuators in ROS, which may be one\\nreason for the success of this framework.\\nRegarding the action modelin this problem, we will send the robot translation\\nand rotation speeds to topic /nav\\nvel, which is of type geometry msgs/msg/Twist.\\nLet’s see this message format:\\n$ ros2 interface show geometry msgs/msg/Twist\\nVector3 linear\\nVector3 angular\\n$ ros2 interface show geometry msgs/msg/Vector3\\nfloat64 x\\nfloat64 y\\nfloat64 z\\nAll robots use this message format to receive speeds, allowing generic teleopera-\\ntion programs (with keyboard, joystick, mobiles, etc.) and navigation in ROS. Once\\nagain, we are talking about standardization.\\nThe geometry\\nmsgs/msg/Twist message is much more generic than what our\\nrobot supports. We cannot make it move in Z (it cannot ﬂy) or move laterally with\\njust two wheels. It is a diﬀerential robot. We could probably do more translations and\\nrotations if we had a quadcopter. We can only make it go forward or backward, rotate,\\nor combine both. For this reason, we can only use the ﬁeldslinear.x and angular.z\\n(rotation to the Z-axis, positive velocities to the left, as indicated in Figure 3.2).\\n3.2 COMPUTATION GRAPH\\nThe Computation Graph of this application will be pretty simple: A single node that\\nsubscribes to the laser topic publishes speed commands to the robot.\\nThe control logic interprets the input sensory information and produces the con-\\ntrol commands. This logic is what we are going to implement with an FSM. The logic\\ncontrol will run iteratively at 20 Hz. The execution frequencies depend on publishing\\nthe control commands. If it is not published above 20 Hz, some robots stop, which\\nis very convenient so that there are no robots without control in the laboratory.'),\n",

You have to deal with this. Engineers do not complain\\nabout problem conditions – they ﬁx them .\\nIf we want our software to run on diﬀerent robots, we must not specify speciﬁc\\ntopics for a robot. In our case, the topic that it subscribes to is /input scan, and\\nit publishes in /output vel. These topics do not exist or correspond to those of\\nour simulated robot. When executing it (at deployment), we will remap the ports to\\nconnect them to the real topics of the speciﬁc robot.\\nLet’s discuss a point here. Why are we using remaps instead of passing the name\\nof the topics as parameters? Well, it is an alternative that many ROS2 developers\\nadvocate. Perhaps this alternative is more convenient when a node does not always\\nhave the same subscribers/publishers, and this can only be speciﬁed in a YAML ﬁle\\nof conﬁguration parameters.\\nA good approach is that if the number of publishers and subscribers in a node is\\nknown, use generic topic names, like the ones used in this example, and perform a\\nremap. It may even be better to use common topic names ( /cmd\\nvel is a common\\ntopic for many robots). A seasoned ROS2 programmer will read in the documentation\\nwhat topics it uses, ﬁnd out with a ros2 node info, and quickly make it work with\\nremaps, instead of looking for the correct parameters to be set up in the conﬁguration\\nﬁles.\\nAlthough this book primarily uses C++, in this chapter we will provide two sim-\\nilar implementations, one in C++ and other in Python, each in diﬀerent packages:\\nbr2\\nfsm bumpgo cpp and br2 fsm bumpgo py.

This strategy al-\\nlows having several programs with diﬀerent strategies for creating nodes. The\\nmain program, whose function is to instantiate the node and call to the\\nspin() function, is in src/bumpgo\\nmain.cpp. We have also included a launcher\\n(launch/bump and go.launch.py) to facilitate its execution.\\nIn this book, we will analyze partial pieces of the code of a package, focusing\\non diﬀerent concrete aspects to teach interesting concepts.

Check\\nout the implementation of the laser callback at scan\\ncallback. Instead of making a\\ncopy of the message (which could be computationally expensive for large messages)\\nor sharing the pointer, we will acquire this message in property, and we will store the\\nreference to the data in last scan .

In the following code, we have only shown the case of the FORWARD state.\\nThere is also a structure in this case: ﬁrst, the output computation in the current\\nstate (setting speeds to publish) and then check every transition condition. If any\\nreturns true (the condition is met), the state\\nis set to the new state and state ts\\nis updated.\\nWhen declaring a message type variable, all its ﬁelds are set by default to their\\ndefault value, or 0 or empty depending on their type.

This subsystem allows deﬁning diﬀerent reference\\naxes (also called frames) and the geometric relationship between them, even when this\\nrelationship is constantly changing. Any coordinate in a frame can be recalculated to\\nanother frame without the need for tedious manual calculations.\\nIn my experience teaching ROS courses, who has had to deal with similar calcu-\\nlations without TFs, shows a big surprise and happiness when they meet them.\\nIts importance in ROS is due to the need to model the parts and components of\\na robot geometrically. It has many applications in navigation and location, as well\\nas manipulation. They have been used to position several cameras in a building or\\nmotion capture systems1.\\nA robot perceives the environment through sensors placed somewhere on the\\nrobot and performs actions for which it needs to specify some spatial position. For\\ninstance:\\n•A distance sensor (laser or RGBD) generates a set of points ( x,y,z ) that indi-\\ncate the detected obstacles.\\n•A robot moves its end eﬀector by specifying a target position (x,y,z,roll,\\npitch,yaw).\\n•A robot moves to a point (x,y,yaw ) on a map.\\nAll these coordinates are references to a frame. In a robot, there are multiple\\nframes (for sensors, actuators, etc). The relationship between these frames must be\\nknown to reason, for example, the coordinate of an obstacle detected by the laser\\non the arm reference axis to avoid it. Frames relationships are the displacement and\\nrotation of a frame to another frame. Algebraically, this is done using homogeneous\\ncoordinates for the coordinates and RT transformation matrices for relations. Having\\nthe coordinates of a point P in frame A, this is PA, we can calculate PB in frame B\\nusing the transformation matrix RTA→B as follows:\\n1https://github.com/MOCAP4ROS2-Project\\nDOI: 10.1201/9781003289623-4 63'),\n",

If this is not true, or several trees\\nare not connected, the robot is not well modeled. By convention, there are several\\nimportant axes:\\n•/base\\nfootprint is usually the root of a robot’s TFs, and corresponds to the\\ncenter of the robot on the ground.

This\\nsimple algorithm is based on using three 2D vectors to calculate the control speed:\\n•Attractive vector: This vector always points forward since the robot wants\\nto move in a straight line in the absence of obstacles.\\n•Repulsive vector: This vector is calculated from the laser sensor readings.

The arrows in Figure 5.1 are visual markers generated by AvoidanceNode for de-\\nbugging. The diﬀerence is using visualization\\nmsgs::msg::MarkerArray instead\\nof visualization msgs::msg::Marker. Basically, a visualization msgs::msg::\\nMarkerArray contains a std::vector of visualization msgs::msg::Marker in its\\nﬁeld markers. Let’s see how the message that will be published as debugging infor-\\nmation is composed. For details of these messages check the message deﬁnitions, and\\nthe reference page3:\\n$ ros2 interface show visualization msgs/msg/MarkerArray\\nMarker[] markers\\n$ ros2 interface show visualization msgs/msg/Marker\\nThe AvoidanceNode header contains what you need to compose and publish the\\nvisual markers.

This strategy has several\\nadvantages:\\n•Ensure that once a part of the software has been tested, other parts’ changes\\ndo not negatively aﬀect what has already been developed.

Activating a CI (Continous Integration) system in your\\nrepository allows that each contribution has to compile correctly and pass all\\nthe tests, both functional and stylish. In this way, the reviewer focuses on\\nverifying that the code does its job correctly.\\n•Many quality assurance procedures require the software to be tested.

In this case,\\nthe behavior tracks the objects that match a speciﬁc color with the robot’s head.\\nThere are several new concepts that are introduced in this project:\\n•Image analysis: So far, we have used a relatively simple sensor. Images provide\\nmore complex perceptual information from which a lot of information can be\\nextracted. Remember that there is an essential part of Artiﬁcial Intelligence\\nthat deals with Artiﬁcial Vision, and it is one of the primary sensors in robots.\\nWe will show how to process these images with OpenCV, the reference library\\nin this area.\\n•Control at joint level: In the previous projects, the commands were speeds\\nsent to the robot. In this case, we will see how to command positions directly\\nto the joints of the robot’s neck.\\n•Lifecycle Nodes: ROS2 provides a particular type of Node called Lifecycle\\nNode. This node is very useful to control the life cycle, including its startup,\\nactivation, and deactivation.\\n5.2.1 Perception and Actuation Models\\nThis project uses the images from the robot’s camera as a source of information.\\nWhenever a node transmits an (non-compressed) image in ROS2 it uses the same\\ntype of message: sensor\\nmsgs/msg/Image. All the drivers of all cameras supported\\nin ROS2 use it. See what the message format is:'),\n",

ROS2\\nprovides tools to transform sensor msgs/msg/Image into cv::Mat, and vice versa:\\nvoid image_callback(const sensor_msgs::msg::Image::ConstSharedPtr & msg)\\n{\\ncv_bridge::CvImagePtr cv_ptr;\\ncv_ptr = cv_bridge::toCvCopy(msg, sensor_msgs::image_encodings::BGR8);\\ncv::Mat & image_src = cv_ptr->image;\\nsensor_msgs::msg::Image image_out = *cv_ptr->toImageMsg();\\n}\\nIn the perception model of our project, the segmentation of an image will be done\\nby color. It is convenient to work in HSV 8, instead of RGB, which is the encoding in\\nwhich we receive the messages. HSV encoding represents a pixel in color with three\\ncomponents: Hue, Saturation, and Value. Working in HSV allows us to establish color\\nranges more robustly to lighting changes since this is what the V component is mainly\\n7https://docs.opencv.org/5.x/d1/dfb/intro.html\\n8https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL and HSV'),\n",

Through two top-\\nics (as shown in Figure 5.5), it allows reading the state of the joints, and sending\\ncommands in the form of a set of waypoints (Figure 5.6) to be reached at speciﬁc\\ntime instants.

If a value is 0, it indicates that it is in the desired position. If\\nit is less than 0, the joint has to move in one direction, and greater than zero has to\\nmove in the other direction. The range of values is [ −1,+1] for each joint, as shown\\nin Figure 5.7.

The reason is that each node\\n(ObjectDetector and HeadController) can be executed separately, and be reused\\nin other problems (we will do it in next chapters). Each one has been designed in\\nthis way to be reusable, with inputs and outputs that try to be generic, not strongly\\ncoupled to this problem.\\nIn this Computation Graph, theHeadController has been represented diﬀerently\\nfrom the rest of the nodes. This node will be implemented asLifeCycle Node, which\\nwe will explain in the Section 5.2.3. For now, we will say that it is like a standard\\nnode but that it can be activated and deactivated during its operation.\\nThe HeadController receives a pan/tilt speed, each in the range [ −1,1]. Note\\nthat since there is no standard ROS2 message that ﬁts our problem (we could have\\nused geometry\\nmsgs/msg/Pose2D, ignoring the ﬁeld theta), we have created a custom\\nbr2 tracking msgs/msg/PanTiltCommand message containing the needed informa-\\ntion. We will see below how we have done to create our custom message.\\nThe ObjectDetector publishes, for each image, the result of the detection of the\\nfurniture in the image. It will return the coordinate, in pixels, of the detection, as\\nwell as the bounding box of the object.\\nThe output of the ObjectDetector does not completely match the input of the\\nHeadController. ObjectDetector publishes its output in pixels. In this case, the\\nimage resolution is 640 ×480 so its range is [0, 640] for the horizontal X component\\nand [0,480] for the vertical Y component. Therefore, we create a node, tracker, with\\na straightforward task, which is to adapt the output of the ObjectDetector to the\\ninput of the HeadController, to make a control in the image, moving the head so\\nthat the detected object is always in the center of the image.\\nwith ROS2'),\n",

In\\nROS2, there is a type of node, the LifeCycleNode, whose lifetime is deﬁned using\\nstates and the transitions between them:\\n•When a LifeCycleNode is created, it is in Unconﬁgured state, and it must\\ntrigger the conﬁgure transition to enter the Inactive state.\\n•A LifeCycleNode is working when it is in the Active state, from which it can\\ntransition from the Inactive state through the activate transition. It is also\\npossible to transition from the Active to Inactive state through the deactivate\\ntransition.\\n•The necessary tasks and checks can be performed at each transition. Even a\\ntransition can fail and not transit if the conditions speciﬁed in the code of its\\ntransition are not met.\\n•In case of error, the node can go to Finalized state.\\n•When a node has completed its task, it can transition to Finalized.\\nSee a diagram of these states and transitions in Figure 5.9.\\nLifecycle nodes provide a node execution model that allows:\\n•Make them predictable. For example, in ROS2, the parameters should be read\\nonly in the conﬁguring transition.\\n•When there are multiple Nodes, we can coordinate their startup. We can deﬁne\\nthat speciﬁc nodes are not activated until they are conﬁgured. We also can\\nspecify some orders in the startup.\\n•Programmatically, it allows having another option beyond the constructor to\\nstart its components. Remember that in C++, a Node is not completely built\\nuntil its constructor has ﬁnished. This usually brings problems if we require a\\nshared\\nptr to this.'),\n",

It would not boot until all its sensor/actuator\\nnodes are in the Active state.\\n5.2.4 Creating Custom Messages\\nWe have previously speciﬁed that the input of node HeadController is of type\\nbr2\\ntracking msgs/msg/PanTiltCommand because there was no type of message that\\nconformed to what we needed. One golden rule in ROS2 is not to create a message\\nif there is already a standard available , as we can beneﬁt from available tools for\\nthis message. In this case, no standard will serve our purposes. In addition, it is the\\nperfect excuse to show how to create custom messages.\\nFirst of all, when creating new messages (new interfaces, in general), even in\\nthe context of a speciﬁc package, it is highly recommended that you make a separate\\npackage, ending in msgs. Tools may exist in the future that needs to receive messages\\nof this new type, but we do not necessarily have to depend on the packages for which\\nthey were created.\\nNext we show the structure of package br2\\ntracking msgs that contains only\\nthe deﬁnition of message br2 tracking msgs/msg/PanTiltCommand:\\nPackage br2 tracking msgs\\nbr2_tracking_msgs/\\nCMakeLists.txt\\nmsg\\nPanTiltCommand.msg\\npackage.xml\\nwith ROS2'),\n",

They have been used in various applications, mainly in video games and\\nrobots. They are usually compared to ﬁnite state machines, but the reality is that\\nthey are diﬀerent approximations. When developing robotic behaviors with (Finite\\nState Machines) FSMs, we think about states and transitions. When we use Behavior\\nTrees, we think of sequences, fallbacks, and many ﬂow resources that give them great\\nexpressiveness. In this chapter, as an illustrative example, we will implement the\\nBump and Go that we did with FSMs in the Chapter 3, and we will see how much\\nthe two approaches diﬀer.\\n6.1 BEHAVIOR TREES\\nA Behavior Tree (BT) is a mathematical model to encode the control of a system.\\nA BT is a way to structure the switching between diﬀerent tasks in an autonomous\\nagent, such as a robot or a virtual entity in a computer game. It is a hierarchical data\\nstructure deﬁned recursively from a root node with several child nodes. Each child\\nnode, in turn, can have more children, and so on. Nodes that do not have children\\nare usually called leaves of the tree.\\nThe basic operation of a node is the tick. When a node is ticked, it can return\\nthree diﬀerent values:\\n•SUCCESS: The node has completed its mission successfully.\\n•FAILURE: The node has failed in its mission.\\n•RUNNING: The node has not yet completed its mission.\\nA BT has four diﬀerent types of nodes:\\nDOI: 10.1201/9781003289623-6\\n115'),\n",

Its function is to spread the\\ntick to their children.\\n•Decorators: They are control nodes with only one child.\\n•Action: They are the leaves of the tree. The user must implement action nodes\\nsince they must generate the control required by the application.\\n•Condition: They are action nodes that cannot return RUNNING. In this case,\\nthe value SUCCESS is understood as the condition it encodes is met, and\\nFAILURE if it is not.\\nFigure 6.1 shows a simple BT. When a BT is executed, the root node is ticked\\nuntil it ﬁnishes executing, that is, until it returns SUCCESS or FAILURE.\\nSequence\\nGo Forward \\n1 meter\\nEnoughBattery?

This node ticks its children\\nin order, starting from left. When a child returns SUCCESS, the sequence node\\nticks the next one. If the child node returns something else, the sequence node\\nreturns this value.\\n•The ﬁrst child, EnoughtBattery?, is a Condition node. If it returns SUCCESS,\\nit indicates that there is enough battery for the robot to carry out its mission so\\nthat the sequence node can advance to the next child. If it returned FAILURE,\\nthe mission would be aborted, as the result of executing the BT would be\\nFAILURE.\\n•The Go Forward action node commands the robot to advance. As long as it\\nhas not traveled 1 m, the node returns RUNNING with each tick. When it has\\ntraveled the speciﬁed distance, it will return SUCCESS.\\n•The Go Forward action node has as its parent a Decorator node that controls\\nthat the frequency at which its child ticks is not greater than 5 Hz. Meanwhile,\\neach tick returns the value returned by the child in the last tick.\\n•The Turn action node is similar to Go Forward, but spinning the robot 2 radi-\\nans.\\nw\\nith ROS2'),\n",

As\\nwe have said before, the user must implement the action nodes, but if we need any\\nother type of node that is not available, we can implement it. In the above example,\\nthe RateController decorator node is not part of the Behavior Tree core library but\\ncan be implemented by the user.\\nA Behavior Tree controls the action decision ﬂow. Leaves are not intended to\\nimplement complex algorithms or subsystems. The BT leaves should coordinate other\\nsubsystems in the robot. In ROS2, this is done by publishing or subscribing to topics\\nor using ROS2 services/actions. Figure 6.2 shows a BT in which the nodes are used\\nto coordinate the actions of a robot. Observe how the complexity is in the subsystem\\nthat coordinates, not in the BT leaves.\\nSequence\\nEnoughBattery?

This node can\\nexpress fallback strategies, that is, what to do if a node returns FAILURE. Figure\\n6.3 shows an example of the use of this node.\\n1. The Fallback node ticks the ﬁrst child. If it returns FAILURE, it ticks the\\nnext child.\\n2. If the second child returns SUCCESS, the Fallback node returns SUCCESS.\\nOtherwise, it ticks the next child.\\n3. If all children have returned FAILURE, the Fallback node returns FAILURE.\\nIn the development cycle with Behavior Trees, we can identify two phases:\\n•Node Development:Action nodes and any other node that the user requires\\nfor their application are designed, developed, and compiled in this phase. These\\nnodes become part of the library of available nodes at the same category as the\\ncore nodes of Behavior Trees.'),\n",

It is important to note that multiple diﬀerent Behavior Trees can be\\ncreated with the same nodes. If the nodes have been designed suﬃciently gen-\\nerally, in this phase, very diﬀerent behaviors of the robot can be deﬁned using\\nthe same nodes.\\nA Behavior Tree has a blackboard, a key/value storage that all nodes in a tree\\ncan access. Nodes can have input ports and output ports to exchange information\\nbetween them. The output ports of one node are connected to the input ports of\\nanother node using a key from the blackboard. While the ports of the nodes (their\\ntype and port class) have to be known at compile-time, the connections are established\\nat deployment-time.\\nFigure 6.4 shows an example of connecting nodes through ports. A DetectObject\\naction node is in charge of detecting some object so that the InformHuman node com-\\nmunicates it to the robot operator. DetectObject uses its output port detected\\nid\\nto send the identiﬁer of the detected object to InformHuman through its port\\nobject id. For this, they use the input of the blackborad whose key objID currently\\nhas the value cup. Using keys from the blackboard is not mandatory. At deployment\\ntime, the value could be a constant value.\\nBehavior Trees are speciﬁed in XML. Although editing tools such as Groot 1 are\\nused, they generate a BT in XML format. If this BT is saved to disk and this ﬁle\\nis loaded from an application, any change to the BT does not require recompiling.\\nThe format is easy to understand, and it is widespread for BTs to be designed di-\\nrectly in XML. The following code shows two equally valid alternatives for the BT in\\nFigure 6.1.\\n1https://github.com/BehaviorTree/Groot\\nwith ROS2'),\n",

Behavior Trees allow sequence nodes with diﬀerent behavior, which is\\nhelpful in some applications.\\n– Sequence\\n:As explained in the previous section, this node ticks its ﬁrst\\nchild. When it returns SUCCESS, the ticks are made to the next child,\\nand so on. If any child returns FAILURE, this node returns FAILURE\\nand, if ticked again, starts over from the ﬁrst child.\\nFigure 6.5 shows an example of a sequence in which to take an image, it\\nmust check that the object is close and that the camera is ready. Once\\nthe camera is pointed at the subject, a picture can be taken. If any of the\\nabove children fail, the sequence fails.

We will deﬁne void, as it is a\\npure virtual method.\\n•The tick method implements the tick operation that we have already described\\nin this chapter.\\n•A static method that returns the ports of the node. In this case, Forward has\\nno ports, so we return an empty list of ports.\\nThe class deﬁnition is also straightforward:\\nsrc/mr2 bt bumpgo/Forward.cpp\\nForward::Forward(\\nconst std::string & xml_tag_name,\\nconst BT::NodeConfiguration & conf)\\n: BT::ActionNodeBase(xml_tag_name, conf)\\n{\\nconfig().blackboard->get(\"node\", node_);\\nvel_pub_ = node_->create_publisher<geometry_msgs::msg::Twist>(\"/output_vel\", 100);\\n}\\nBT::NodeStatus\\nForward::tick()\\n{\\ngeometry_msgs::msg::Twist vel_msgs;\\nvel_msgs.linear.x = 0.3;\\nvel_pub_->publish(vel_msgs);\\nreturn BT::NodeStatus::RUNNING;\\n}\\n} // namespace br2_bt_bumpgo\\n#include \"behaviortree_cpp_v3/bt_factory.h\"\\nBT_REGISTER_NODES(factory)\\n{\\nfactory.registerNodeType<br2_bt_bumpgo::Forward>(\"Forward\");\\n}\\n•In the constructor, after calling the constructor of the base class, we will get the\\npointer to the ROS2 node of the blackboard.

Let’s see some peculiarities:\\n•The BT node Turn performs its task for 3 s, so it saves the timestamp of its\\nﬁrst tick, which is identiﬁable because its state is still IDLE:\\nsrc/mr2 bt bumpgo/Turn.cpp\\nBT::NodeStatus\\nTurn::tick()\\n{\\nif (status() == BT::NodeStatus::IDLE) {\\nstart_time_ = node_->now();\\n}\\ngeometry_msgs::msg::Twist vel_msgs;\\nvel_msgs.angular.z = 0.5;\\nvel_pub_->publish(vel_msgs);\\nauto elapsed = node_->now() - start_time_;\\nif (elapsed < 3s) {\\nreturn BT::NodeStatus::RUNNING;\\n} else {\\nreturn BT::NodeStatus::SUCCESS;\\n}\\n}\\n•The BT node isObstacle saves the laser readings and compares them to the\\ndistance set on its input port:\\nsrc/mr2 bt bumpgo/isObstacle.cpp\\nvoid\\nIsObstacle::laser_callback(sensor_msgs::msg::LaserScan::UniquePtr msg)\\n{\\nlast_scan_ = std::move(msg);\\n}\\nBT::NodeStatus\\nIsObstacle::tick()\\n{\\ndouble distance = 1.0;\\ngetInput(\"distance\"\\n, distance);\\nif (last_scan_->ranges[last_scan_->ranges.size() / 2] < distance) {\\nreturn BT::NodeStatus::SUCCESS;\\n} else {\\nreturn BT::NodeStatus::FAILURE;\\n}\\n}\\nEach of the BT nodes will be compiled as a separate library.

A program should build a tree and start\\nticking its root until it returns SUCCESS. Behavior trees are created using a\\nBehaviorTreeFactory, specifying an XML ﬁle or directly a string that contains\\nthe XML. BehaviorTreeFactory needs to load the libraries of the custom nodes as\\nplugins and needs the blackboard to be shared among the BT nodes.\\nTo integrate behavior trees with ROS2, create a ROS2 node and put it on the\\nblackboard. As shown before, BT nodes can extract it from the blackboard to create\\npublishers/subscribers or clients/servers of services or actions. Along with the tick at\\nthe root of the tree, a spin\\nsome manages the arrival of messages to the ROS2 node.\\nSee how it looks like the program that carries out the tree creation and execution:\\nsrc/mr2 bt bumpgo/isObstacle.cpp\\nint main(int argc, char * argv[])\\n{\\nrclcpp::init(argc, argv);\\nauto node = rclcpp::Node::make_shared(\"patrolling_node\");\\nBT::BehaviorTreeFactory factory;\\nBT::SharedLibrary loader;\\nfactory.registerFromPlugin(loader.getOSName(\"br2_forward_bt_node\"));\\nfactory.registerFromPlugin(loader.getOSName(\"br2_back_bt_node\"));\\nfactory.registerFromPlugin(loader.getOSName(\"br2_turn_bt_node\"));\\nfactory.registerFromPlugin(loader.getOSName(\"br2_is_obstacle_bt_node\"));\\nstd::string pkgpath = ament_index_cpp::get_package_share_directory(\"br2_bt_bumpgo\");\\nstd::string xml_file = pkgpath + \"/behavior_tree_xml/bumpgo.xml\";'),\n",

At the beginning of the main function, we create a generic ROS2 node which\\nwe then insert into the blackboard.

The tree is created by a BT::BehaviorTreeFactory from an XML, BT action\\nnodes that we will be implemented, and a blackboard.\\n(a) As we will see below, each BT node will be compiled as an independent\\nlibrary. The loader object helps to ﬁnd the library in the system to load\\nthe BT Node as a plugin.

Upon reach-\\ning each waypoint, the robot turns on itself for a few seconds to perceive its\\nsurroundings.\\n•While the robot goes from one waypoint to another, the robot perceives and\\ntracks the detected objects.\\n•The robot keeps track (simulated) of the battery level it has.

Like its predecessor in ROS, it aspires to be the most widely used naviga-\\ntion software, so it supports major robot types: holonomic, diﬀerential-drive, legged,\\nand Ackermann (car-like) while allowing information from lasers and 3D cameras to\\nbe merged, among others. Nav2 incorporates multiple plugins for local and global\\nnavigation and allows custom plugins to be easily used.\\nThe inputs to Nav2 are TF transformations (conforming to REP-105), a map 5,\\nany relevant sensor data sources. It also requires the navigation logic, coded as a BT\\nXML ﬁle coded, adapting it to speciﬁc problems if needed.

Values between 1 and 253 encode diﬀerent\\noccupation degrees or cost to cross this area. Figure 6.16b shown the map coded\\nas a costmap2D.\\n•AMCL: This component implements a localization algorithm based on Adap-\\ntive Monte-Carlo (AMCL) [9].

It takes as input the destination, the current\\nposition of the robot, and the map of the environment. The Planner Server\\nbuilds a costmap from the original map, whose walls are fattened with the\\nradius of the robot and a certain safety margin. The idea is that the robot uses\\nthe free space (or with low cost) to calculate the routes, as shown in Figure\\n6.16a. Route planning and costmap updating algorithms are loaded as plugins.\\nLike the following two components, this component receives requests through\\nROS2 actions.\\n•Controller Server: This component receives the route calculated by the Plan-\\nner Server and publishes the speeds sent to the robot base. It uses a costmap of\\nthe robot’s surroundings (seeFigure 6.16b), where nearby obstacles are encoded\\nand used by algorithms (loaded as plugins) to calculate speeds.\\n•Recovery Server: This component has several helpful recovery strategies if\\nthe robot gets lost, gets stuck, or cannot calculate routes to the destination.\\nThese strategies are turning, clearing costmaps, slow-moving, among others.\\nwith ROS2'),\n",

It receives navigation requests in the form\\nof ROS2 actions. The action name is navigate to pose and the type is\\nnav2 msgs/action/NavigateToPose. Therefore, if we want to make a robot\\ngo from one point to another, we must use this ROS2 action. Check out what\\nthis action looks like:\\nros2 interface show nav2 msgs/action/NavigateToPose\\n#goal definition\\ngeometry msgs/PoseStamped pose\\nstring behavior tree\\n---\\n#result definition\\nstd\\nmsgs/Empty result\\n---\\ngeometry\\nmsgs/PoseStamped current pose\\nbuiltin interfaces/Duration navigation time\\nint16 number of recoveries\\nfloat32 distance remaining\\n– The request section comprises a target position and, optionally, a custom\\nBehavior Tree to be used in this action instead of the default one. This last\\nfeature allows special requests to be made that are not normal navigation\\nbehavior, such as following a moving object or approaching an obstacle in\\na particular way.\\n– The result of the action, when ﬁnished.\\n– The robot continuously returns the current position and the distance to\\nthe target and statistical data such as the navigation time or the times it\\nhas recovered from undesirable situations.\\nBT Navigator uses Behavior Trees to orchestrate robot navigation. The Behav-\\nior Tree nodes make requests to the other components of Nav2 so that they\\ncarry out their task.\\nWhen this component accepts a navigation action, it starts executing a Be-\\nhavior Tree like the one shown in Figure 6.17. Nav2’s default Behavior Tree is\\nquite a bit more complex, including calls to recoveries, but the one in the ﬁgure\\nis quite illustrative of BT Navigator Server’s use of them. First, the goal that\\narrives in the ROS2 action is put on the blackboard. ComputePathToPose uses\\nthis goal to call the Planner Server action, which returns a route to it.

They are in include/br2\\nbt patrolling/ctrl support, and have been\\nimplemented in a general way so that they can be reused for other projects.\\nThe BTActionNode class has been borrowed from Nav2, where the BT Navigator\\nServer used it to control the rest of its servers. It is quite a complex class since\\nit considers many more cases than we use in this project, such as cancellation and\\nresends of actions.
